with first order logic to generate quaeries compound sentences, negation, scalar adjectives etc.
Dataset used for evaluation can be downloaded at ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/mooney/nl-ilp-data/geosystem/geobase(We specifically used the dataset that is composed of geography data in the United States)  and https://github.com/ag-sc/QALD/tree/master/9/data(9th challenge on question answering over linked data)
To use the system to evaluate your queries you should first download parot.jar from the main project directory
